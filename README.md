# PyGame Cultivation Game
Abandoned attempt at a simple RPG in PyGame. Had fun experimenting with GUI options and rendering stuff!

If you want to run the game for some reason you need to install the PyGame library using this command in a terminal:
```
pip install pygame
```
The rest of the libraries (random and os) are standard libraries and should come with Python.

To run the game, run start.bat (Make sure you have Python in your system's PATH environment variable)
